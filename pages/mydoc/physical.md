Physical attacks and physical red teaming involve using physical access and manipulation to gain unauthorized access to a system or facility. These types of attacks can include theft, destruction, or tampering with physical assets. Physical red teaming is a simulation of these types of attacks to test an organization's physical security measures.


## Shoulder surfing attack

shoulder surfing attack, where an attacker gains access to sensitive information by looking over someone's shoulder as they enter passwords or other confidential data. This type of attack can be mitigated by implementing physical barriers or using privacy screens.


## Dumpster diving


dumpster diving, where an attacker searches through an organization's trash to find sensitive information such as passwords, documents, or other data. This type of attack can be prevented by implementing secure shredding practices and limiting access to trash areas.



Physical red teaming involves creating simulations of these types of attacks to test an organization's physical security measures. This can include testing access control systems, security cameras, and physical barriers. By performing physical red teaming exercises, organizations can identify weaknesses in their physical security and take steps to improve it.


## Drone


1.Plan your mission: Determine the objective of the mission, the target location, and the route to get there.

2.Choose your drone: Select a drone that has the appropriate features for your mission, such as a camera for surveillance or a payload for delivery.

3.Test your drone: Before the mission, test the drone to ensure that it is functioning properly and can perform the required tasks.

4.Plan your drone flight path: Plan the flight path of the drone to avoid detection and maximize effectiveness.

5.Fly the drone: Use the controller or software to fly the drone to the target location.

6.Perform the mission: Use the drone for the intended purpose, such as taking pictures or delivering a payload.

7.Retrieve the drone: Retrieve the drone after the mission is complete.

8.Analyze the results: Analyze the data or payload obtained from the mission to achieve your objective.

9.Cover your tracks: Remove any evidence that the drone was used during the mission to avoid detection.

## lock-picking


1.Gather necessary tools: You'll need a set of lock picks, a tension wrench, and possibly a pick gun or electric pick.

2.Identify the type of lock: Different types of locks require different techniques and tools. Common types include pin-tumbler, wafer-tumbler, and disc-detainer locks.

3.Insert tension wrench: Insert the tension wrench into the bottom of the keyhole and apply slight pressure in the direction the lock turns.

4.Insert pick: Insert the pick into the top of the keyhole and begin pushing up on the pins, feeling for the binding pin.

5.Set binding pin: Once you feel the binding pin, push up on it with the pick until it clicks into place.

6.Repeat: Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each remaining pin, until all pins are set.

7.Turn lock: While maintaining tension with the wrench, turn the lock with the pick until it opens.
